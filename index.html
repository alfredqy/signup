        <h3>GOING OUT TONIGHT?</h3>
        <p>
          We're building an app to help you answer the question you have every Friday night: <i>"Where do I want to go tonight?"</i>
          <br/><br/>
          We find the best Toronto venues and bring the people you actually want to hang out with. Just show up, bring some cool friends and have a good time.
        </p>

      <div class="box">
        <h3>NO SQUARES</h3>
        <p>How do we keep the vibe right? You pick the guest list! <i>The List</i> is invite only, so everyone who shows up will be just like you: cool, easy going, and most impotantly, fun to be around.
          <br/><br/>
          Sign up before you end up at that weird bar around the corner again this weekend.
